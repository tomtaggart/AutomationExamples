# AutomationExamples
Selection of work I've done automating in Python code, shell scripting, or launchd xml.  The code here has been scrubbed to remove security keys, passwords, and customer names.  For this reason the code won't run as it normally would in the real world.  The code here is given as an example of the type of work I've done.  I am constantly striving to write cleaner, easier to read, and well documented code; it's a life long process.  I also work towards test driven development when possible.
